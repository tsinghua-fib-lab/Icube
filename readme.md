# Predicting Cascade Failures in Interdependent Urban Infrastructure Networks

This repo contains the source code and datasets for our paper "Predicting Cascade Failures in Interdependent Urban Infrastructure Networks"

## Our Model
You can make predictions with the program in folder ``prediction``.
### $I^3$ Model
You can find the implementatino of model $I^3$ in the file ``model.py`` in folder ``prediction``
### Train the model
You can use the coed in the ``train.py`` to train the prediction model and make predictions.
